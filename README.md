This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# The Fan Lane Repository
## Description
This repository contains the source code and related resources for The Fan Lane, a decentralized application (DApp) designed to address the issue of ticket scalping in the mass events industry in Mexico. The main goal of The Fan Lane is to provide true fans with the opportunity to purchase tickets at fair prices and enjoy their favorite shows without any hassle.
## Problem
In the mass events industry in Mexico, ticket scalping is a persistent problem that affects genuine fans of artists, athletes, and performances. This situation often leads to many fans being unable to attend events or having to pay exorbitant prices to gain entry. This has generated widespread discontent among the population due to the increasing unfairness in ticket prices.
## Proposed Solution
Our solution involves developing a DApp that allows true fans to purchase tickets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to see their favorite artists. The application will be integrated with Spotify and will utilize the information from this platform to verify the authenticity of fans interested in attending a concert. It is important to note that this restriction will only apply to the pre-sale of tickets, not the general sale. The requirements for purchasing tickets in the pre-sale are as follows: the artist must be among the top 10 most listened-to artists by the fan for at least one year prior to the pre-sale day.
## DApp Components
The DApp consists of the following main components:
1.	**Home Screen:** This displays the main concerts and provides various search options to find other available events.
2.	**Spotify Authentication:** To ensure compliance with the established requirements, users will be required to log in to Spotify to verify their affinity with the artist.
3.	**Concert and Date Selection:** Once authenticated, users can choose their preferred show and select a specific date on which the artist will perform.
4.	**Zone and Seat Selection:** After choosing the date, users can select the preferred zone and seat within the event venue.
5.	**Payment Process:** Once the selections are complete, users will proceed to make the corresponding payment to acquire the chosen tickets.
Additionally, from the home screen, users who have purchased tickets in the pre-sale will be able to access additional features such as transportation, lockers, and mobile device chargers utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT).
